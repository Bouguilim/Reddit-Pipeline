# Reddit Video Games Review Pipeline

Our project involves building a comprehensive data pipeline to analyze public sentiment and opinions on a video game, which serves as the input to the pipeline. We extract relevant data from Reddit and other sources, clean and process it, then apply large language models (LLMs) for sentiment analysis. The results are visualized on a dashboard, providing valuable insights into how people feel about the game, including whether their sentiments are positive or negative, and highlighting key opinions. We selected Reddit because it offers candid, unfiltered discussions where users freely express their thoughts.
